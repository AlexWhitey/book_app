## Overview
We want to create an application for users to search for books corresponding to Author or Title.



## Getting Started
User must set up proper Developer environment, while building basic server initialization with proper NPM packages installed and updated. While creating proper HTML and CSS framework for "proof of life", as well as building out routes for API(s), handlers, and constructors.



## Architecture
We will be using JS, JQuery, and EJS for templating our javascript. We will also be importing basic framework from a prebuilt work environment. Our server will be hosted by heroku while deployed. Locally we will be using live-server and nodemon to do stability testing and debugging.

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
